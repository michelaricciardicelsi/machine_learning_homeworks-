HW 1: This work is aimed at training and validating a supervised learning algorithm for classifying malware families, that is, 
for detecting which malware family a given malware sample belongs to, based on the DREBIN dataset and relying on Extreme Gradient Boosting.

HW 2: This work describes a deep neural network based approach to the classification of boats travelling in the canals of Venice into 
5 different classes. Transfer learning was adopted to reduce the training time for the classification model.
The dataset I used is available online on the website of the ARGOS (Automatic Remote Grand  Canal Observation System , 2006-2007) project.
